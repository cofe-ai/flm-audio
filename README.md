# FLM-Audio

[[Hugging Face]](https://huggingface.co/CofeAI/flm-audio)

FLM-Audio is a audio-language subversion of [RoboEgo/FLM-Ego](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01934v1) -- an omnimodal model with native full duplexity. It simultaneously listens, speaks, and composes internal monologue, delivering low‑latency, duplex conversational responses in both English and Chinese. FLM‑Audio is robust to noise and user interruptions, prioritizing responsiveness and naturalness.
